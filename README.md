# SwissQRCode
Delphi v21 / RadStudio 10.4.x Source to create the Swiss QR Code as a TBitmap. The code should work with earlier and also with newer versions of RadStudio as well. Nothing special is used. The code works so far only for Windows VCL (no FMX! But I'm working on a FMX Version).

Based on the DelphiZXingQRCode-Source I've created some wrapper-files to create the official Swiss Payment Code (SPC) as defined by Six-Group. There is a DemoApp which showes how to use the files. Please see the code how to use it.
This code is of no use outside Switzerland.
