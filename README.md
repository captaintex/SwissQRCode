# SwissQRCode
Delphi v21 / RadStudio 10.4.x Source to create the Swiss QR Code as a TBitmap.

Based on the DelphiZXingQRCode-Source I've created some wrapper-files to create the official Swiss Payment Code (SPC) as defined by Six-Group. There is a DemoApp which showes how to use the files. Please see the code how to use it.
This code is of no use outside Switzerland.
